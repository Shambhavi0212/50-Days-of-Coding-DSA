🧩 Problem Solved: Swap First and Last Characters of Each Word

📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Character Swapping

📝 Today,I:

Solved a string manipulation problem that required swapping the first and last characters of each word in a sentence.
For example, given the input "hello world", the output was "oellh dorlw".
This challenge improved my understanding of string operations and array handling in Java.

💡 Approach:

1.Read the input string using Scanner.
2.Split the string into words using split(" ").
3.For each word longer than one character:
4.Convert it to a character array.
5.Swap the first and last characters.
6.Join the modified words back into a sentence and print the result.

🛠️ Concepts Used:

1.String Splitting
2.Character Arrays
3.Swapping Logic
4.String Joining

⏳ Time Complexity(TC): O(N), where N is the total number of characters in the sentence.
📦 Space Complexity(SC): O(1) (ignoring the output string).
