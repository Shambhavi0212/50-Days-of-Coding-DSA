🧩 Problem Solved: Reverse Characters of a String while Preserving Space Positions

📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Character Reversal | Index Management

📝 Today, I:
Solved a string manipulation problem where I had to reverse the characters of a given string but keep the spaces in their original positions.
For example, for the input:
"I am a coder"
The output is:
"r edo a ma I"

💡 Approach:
1. Convert the string to a character array for easier manipulation.
2. Create a new array for the result.
3. Traverse the original string and reverse non-space characters, skipping spaces.
4. Place the reversed characters in the correct positions, maintaining the spaces.

🛠️ Concepts Used:

1.String Traversal
2.Array Manipulation
3.Index Handling & Conditional Checks

⏳ Time Complexity(TC):O(N) — where N is the length of the string
📦 Space Complexity(SC):O(N) — for the new array to store the result
