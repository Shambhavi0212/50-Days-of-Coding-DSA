📢 🚀 Day4️⃣8️⃣/50 : CodeChef Challenge  

🧩 Problem Solved: Snapchat Streak  
📊 Problem Type: Arrays | Logic Building | Streak Counting  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved an interesting logical problem from CodeChef where I had to calculate the **maximum consecutive streak** days maintained between two friends on Snapchat, based on their daily snap exchanges.

📥 Example Input:
4  
3  
3 1 2  
2 4 1  
2  
0 0  
10 10  
4  
5 4 0 2  
3 1 1 0  
5  
0 1 1 2 0  
1 1 0 0 3  

📤 Output:
3  
0  
2  
1  

💡 Approach:
1. Read `T`, the number of test cases  
2. For each test case, read `N` and then read `A[]` and `B[]` arrays  
3. Iterate over the days:  
   - If both A[i] and B[i] > 0, increment `current streak`  
   - Else, reset `current streak` to 0  
   - Keep track of `maximum streak` encountered  
4. Print the maximum streak for each test case  

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. Arrays  
2. Looping and conditional logic  
3. Max tracking pattern  
4. Scanner input handling in Java  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N) per test case  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N) per test case
