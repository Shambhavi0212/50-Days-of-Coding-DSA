🧩 Problem Solved: Check if One String is a Rotation of Another

📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Substring Search | Logical Thinking

📝 Today, I: Solved a logic-based problem where I determined if one string is a rotation of another.
For example:
"deabc" is a rotation of "abcde" ✅

💡 Approach:

1.Read both strings using Scanner.
2.If lengths differ, print False.
3.Otherwise, concatenate s1 with itself → s1 + s1.
4.Check if s2 is a substring of that result.
5.Print True if yes, else False.

🛠️ Concepts Used:

1.String Concatenation
2.Substring Checking
3.Conditional Logic

⏳ Time Complexity (TC):O(N) — where N is the length of the string
📦 Space Complexity (SC):O(N) — due to string duplication
