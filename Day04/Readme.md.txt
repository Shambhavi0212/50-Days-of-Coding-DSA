🎯 Problem Solved: "MIN To MAX" (Java)

CodeChef Link : https://www.codechef.com/practice/course/arrays/ARRAYS/problems/OPMIN

I solved a coding challenge where the task was to make the minimum value in an array become the maximum, using the least number of operations.

💡 Key idea:

Find the smallest value in the array.

Count how many elements are greater than it.

Change those to match the minimum.

📌 Language: Java
📚 Concept: Arrays, Greedy Thinking, Counting
🔁 Sample Input/Output tested and passed successfully!

It’s small problems like these that sharpen logical thinking and boost coding confidence 💪
