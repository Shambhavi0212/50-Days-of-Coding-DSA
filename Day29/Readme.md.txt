🧩 Problem Solved: Reverse the Shortest Word

📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Searching | String Reversal

📝 Today, I:
Solved a string manipulation problem where I had to find the shortest word in a sentence and print its reverse. If multiple words have the same shortest length, the first one is considered.

For example, for the input:
This is a test
The output is:
a

💡 Approach:
1.Read the input string using Scanner.
2.Split the string into words using split(" ").
3.Iterate through the words to find the shortest one.
4.Reverse the shortest word using StringBuilder.
5.Print the reversed word.

🛠️ Concepts Used:

1.String Splitting
2.String Traversal
3.StringBuilder for reversal
4.Conditional Statements

⏳ Time Complexity (TC):O(N) — where N is the total number of words in the sentence.
📦 Space Complexity (SC):O(1) — only storing the shortest word.
