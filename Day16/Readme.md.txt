🚀 Day 1️⃣6️⃣/50 - Single Number

✅ LeetCode #136  
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/

🧩 Problem:
Given a non-empty array `nums`(I modified to a), where every element appears twice except one, find the element that appears only once.

Must run in linear time and use constant space.

🧪 Examples:
Input: [2,2,1] → Output: 1  
Input: [4,1,2,1,2] → Output: 4  
Input: [1] → Output: 1

💡 Tip:
XOR all elements — duplicates cancel out, leaving the unique one.

⏱ TC:O(N)  
📦 SC:O(1)
