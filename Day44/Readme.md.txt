🧩 Problem Solved: Delete X from List
📊 Problem Type: Array | Filtering | Input/Output | Basic Manipulation

📝 Today, I:
Solved a neat array filtering problem from CodeChef, where I had to remove all occurrences of a given number X from an array and print the updated list.

📥 Example Input:
5  
1 3 5 3 9  
3  
📤 Output:
1 5 9

💡 Approach:
1. Read N and the array elements using Scanner.
2. Read the number X to be deleted.
3.Use a single loop to overwrite elements not equal to X in-place.
4.Print only the filtered portion of the array using a separate index pointer.

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1.Arrays
2.Input/Output Handling
3.In-place Filtering
4.Index Tracking

⏳ Time Complexity:O(N)
📦 Space Complexity:O(1) (in-place filtering)

🔥 Practicing problems like this helps reinforce clean logic building and strengthens problem-solving fundamentals in Java!
