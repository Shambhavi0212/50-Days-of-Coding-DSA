🧩 Problem Solved: Count Substring Occurrences (including overlaps)
📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Pattern Matching

📝 Today, I:
Solved a classic string-search problem where I had to count how many times a substring appears in a main string, even when the matches overlap.

📥 Example Input:
abababa
aba

📤 Output:
3

💡 Approach:
1. Read both input strings using Scanner.
2.Iterate through the main string until the remaining part is smaller than the substring.
3.Use substring(i, i + sub.length()) and compare with sub.
4.Increment the counter if a match is found.
5.Print the final count.

🛠️ Concepts Used:

1.Substring comparison
2.Sliding window technique
3.String indexing

⏳ Time Complexity (TC):O(N×M) — where N is the length of the main string, M is the length of the substring
📦 Space Complexity (SC):O(1) — constant extra space
