🚀 Day 2️⃣0️⃣/50: LeetCode #28
🔍 Problem Solved: Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
🔗 LeetCode Problem Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/submissions/1640522090/

🧩 Problem Statement:
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack.
If it doesn't exist, return -1.

🧪 Test Cases:
✅ "sadbutsad","sad"→Output: 0
❌ "leetcode","leeto"→Output: -1
✅ "hello","ll"→Output: 2

💡 Approach:
I used Java’s built-in indexOf() method to solve this efficiently.
It’s concise and uses Java's optimized internal implementation.

🧠 Time Complexity:O(n*m) in the worst case for naive search
💾 Space Complexity:O(1)
📌 Where n=length of haystack,m=length of needle
