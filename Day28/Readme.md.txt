🧩 Problem Solved: Count Vowels and Consonants in a Sentence

📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Counting | Character Analysis

📝 Today, I:
Solved a string manipulation problem where I counted the number of vowels and consonants in a sentence.
For example, for the input "India is my country", the output was:
Vowels: 6, Consonants: 10.

💡 Approach:
1. Read the input string using Scanner.
2. Traverse each character, check if it’s a vowel or consonant.
3. Maintain counters for both vowels and consonants.
4. Print the results in the required format.

🛠️ Concepts Used:

1.String Traversal
2.Character Handling
3.Conditional Statements

⏳ Time Complexity (TC):O(N) — where N is the length of the string.
📦 Space Complexity (SC):O(1) — constant space for counters.
