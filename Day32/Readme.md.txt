🧩 Problem Solved: Determine if Two Strings Share a Common Character

📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Nested Loops | Character Matching

📝 Today, I:
Solved a problem where I checked if two given strings share at least one common character without using any collection data structures like HashSet or ArrayList.

💡 Approach:
1. Convert both strings to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.
2. Use nested loops to compare each character of the first string with every character of the second string.
3. If any common character is found, break out of loops and print "Yes".
4. Otherwise, print "No".

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. String Traversal
2. Character Comparison
3. Nested Loops

⏳ Time Complexity (TC):O(|s1|*|s2|) — since nested loops check all pairs.
📦 Space Complexity (SC):O(1) — no extra space besides variables.
