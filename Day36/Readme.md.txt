🔍 Problem Solved: First Non-Repeating Character in a String

📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Character Frequency

📝 Today, I:
Solved a problem that required identifying the first character in a string that does not repeat.

💡 Approach:

1.Read the string using Scanner.
2.Traverse the string using two nested loops.
3.For each character, check if it appears more than once.
4.Print the first character with no duplicates.
5.If none found, print "None".

🛠️ Concepts Used:

1.Nested Loop
2.Character Comparison
3.Boolean Flag
4.String Traversal

⏳ Time Complexity (TC):O(N²) — due to nested loops
📦 Space Complexity (SC):O(1) — only a few variables used
