🔡 Problem Solved: Character Rotation in a String

📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Character Shifting | Modular Arithmetic

📝 Today, I:
Solved a fun character manipulation challenge where I had to rotate each character in a string by k positions in the alphabet. If it passed 'z', it wraps around from 'a'.

📌 Example:
Input: middleoutz, k = 2
Output: okffngqwvb

💡 Approach:
1.Read the input string and rotation value.
2.Traverse the string character by character.
3.Apply modular arithmetic to wrap around 'z'.
4.Print the rotated result.

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1.String Traversal
2.ASCII-based Character Rotation
3.Modular Arithmetic

Concatenating Characters into String
⏳ Time Complexity:O(N)— where N is the length of the string.
📦 Space Complexity:O(1)— except for the output string.
