 Problem Solved: "Cost of Groceries" (Java)

I recently solved a coding challenge where the task was to calculate the total cost of grocery items 
that meet a minimum freshness threshold.

💡 Key idea:

✔️ Read two arrays: one for freshness, one for cost.  
✔️ Only add the cost of items whose freshness is greater than or equal to the threshold.

📌 Language: Java  
📚 Concept: Arrays, Conditional Checks, Looping  
🕒 Time Complexity: O(N) — where N is the number of items  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N) — for storing input arrays  
🔁 Sample Input/Output tested and passed successfully!

It’s small problems like these that sharpen logic, boost confidence, and build consistency 💪

On a journey of continuous learning 🚀
