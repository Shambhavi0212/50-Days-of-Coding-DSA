🧩 Problem Solved: ASCII Sum of Each Word

📝 Today, I:
Solved a string manipulation problem where I calculated the ASCII sum of each word in a sentence.
For example, for the input "Hello World", the output was "Hello : 500 World : 520".

💡 Approach:
1)Took input string.
2)Split the string into words using .split(" ").
3)For each word, iterated through every character and summed their ASCII values.
4)Printed the word followed by its ASCII sum.

🛠️ Concepts Used:

1)String Splitting
2)Nested Loops
3)ASCII Character Handling

⏳ Time Complexity (TC):O(N) — where N is the total number of characters in the input, since each character is processed once.
📦 Space Complexity (SC):O(N) — due to storing the split words array.

🌱 Excited to keep pushing forward on this #LearningAndGrowing journey!
