🧩 Problem Solved: Capitalize First Letter of Each Word

📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Capitalization | Word Processing

📝 Today, I:
Solved a neat formatting problem where I had to capitalize the first letter of every word in a sentence without altering the rest of the letters.

📥 Example Input:
data science with python
📤 Output:
Data Science With Python

💡 Approach:

1. Read the string using Scanner.
2.Split the string into words using split(" ").
3.Capitalize the first character of each word, then append the rest unchanged.
4.Combine the results and print the final formatted sentence.

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1.String Splitting
2.Character Case Conversion
3.String Concatenation

⏳ Time Complexity (TC): O(N) — where N is the length of the string
📦 Space Complexity (SC): O(1) — constant extra space (excluding input/output)
