📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Counting | Character Analysis

📝 Today, I:
Solved a straightforward string counting problem due to some other works occupying time.
The program reads a string and counts uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Output is formatted clearly as specified.

💡 Approach:
1. Read input string using Scanner.
2. Loop through each character and check character type using ASCII ranges.
3. Maintain counters for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
4. Print counts in the required format.

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. String Traversal
2. Character Handling
3. Conditional Statements

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N),where N is the length of the string.
📦 Space Complexity: O(1)— only counters used.
