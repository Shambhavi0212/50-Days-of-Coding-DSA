🧩 Problem Solved: Red Light, Green Light  
📊 Problem Type: Greedy | Array | Line of Sight | Elimination Logic  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved an interesting logical simulation problem from CodeChef where I had to determine the number of players blocking the view between two people of equal height. If a player in between is taller than them, they block the line of sight and must be eliminated.

📥 Example Input:
3  
4 10  
2 13 4 16  
5 8  
9 3 8 8 4  
4 6  
1 2 3 4  

📤 Output:  
2  
1  
0  

💡 Approach:  
1. Read number of test cases `T`  
2. For each test case:  
   - Read `N` (number of players) and `K` (height of Gi-Hun and Ali)  
   - Store the `N` heights in an array  
   - Count how many of these are greater than `K` — those are blocking players  
3. Print the count for each test case  

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. Arrays  
2. Conditional Checks  
3. Input/Output Handling  
4. Efficient loop execution for large T  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(T * N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N) per test case
