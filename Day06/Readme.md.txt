🎯 Day 6️⃣/50

✅ Problem Solved: "Running Comparison" (Java)

🔗 CodeChef Link: https://www.codechef.com/practice/course/arrays/ARRAYS/problems/RUNCOMPARE

Today, I tackled an interesting logical problem involving comparison of daily running distances between two people — Alice and Bob. The goal was to count how many days both were happy, based on specific conditions.

💡 Key Logic:

For each day, check if Bob ran strictly more than twice the distance of Alice → Alice is unhappy.

Check if Alice ran strictly more than twice the distance of Bob → Bob is unhappy.

Count the days when both were happy.

📌 Language: Java
📚 Concepts Used: Arrays, Conditional Checks, Greedy Thinking, Counting
