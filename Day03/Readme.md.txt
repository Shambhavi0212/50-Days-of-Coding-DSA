Today solved a fun problem where I had to decide if Chef should buy a discount coupon based on whether it saves money in total. ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¸

ðŸ“Œ Problem Summary:

Given prices of items and a discount coupon.

The coupon reduces each itemâ€™s price by Y (minimum price = 0) and costs X.

Buy the coupon only if total cost (after discount + X) is less than original total.

âœ… What I practiced:

Using loops and conditionals in Java

Working with arrays and input handling

Optimizing total cost calculations
