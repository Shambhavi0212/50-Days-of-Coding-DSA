🚀 Day 1️⃣1️⃣/50 - Two Sum  
✅ Problem Solved: "Two Sum"  
🔗 LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

🧩 Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

- Each input has exactly one solution.
- You may not use the same element twice.
- Return the answer in any order.

🧪 Examples:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6  
Output: [1,2]

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6  
Output: [0,1]

🔍 Constraints:
- 2 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁴  
- -10⁹ ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁹  
- -10⁹ ≤ target ≤ 10⁹  
- Only one valid answer exists.

🧠 Concepts Used:
- Array traversal  
- Nested loop comparison (Brute-force)  
- Index tracking  

⏱ Time Complexity: O(n²) – Checked all possible pairs  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1) – No extra space used

🎯 Learning Outcome:
✔️ Practiced identifying target pairs in arrays  
✔️ Revisited brute-force approach with nested loops  
✔️ Strengthened logic building through examples

🌱 Staying consistent and building strong foundations!
