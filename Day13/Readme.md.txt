✅ Problem Solved: "To Lower Case"

🔗 LeetCode Link: [https://leetcode.com/problems/to-lower-case/]

🧩 Problem Statement:

Given a string s,return the string after replacing every uppercase letter with the same lowercase letter.

🧪 Examples:  
Input: s = "Hello"  
Output: "hello"  

Input: s = "LOVELY"  
Output: "lovely"

---

Approach I used :
🔹 Brute-force Approach (O(n))  
Concept: Use the built-in `toLowerCase()` method to directly convert all characters in the string to lowercase.

⏳ Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we only need to traverse the string once.  
💾 Space Complexity: O(1), no extra space is used.

Pros: Very efficient and concise.  
Cons: Dependent on built-in methods.
