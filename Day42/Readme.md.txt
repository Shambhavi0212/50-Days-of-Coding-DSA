📢 🚀 Day4️⃣2️⃣/50: 
🧩 Problem Solved: Merging 2 Arrays
📊 Problem Type: Arrays | Merging Logic
🎯 Difficulty: 925
🎓 Platform: CodeChef - Learn Java Course

📝 Today, I:
Merged two 1D arrays by creating a new array large enough to hold both, then copying each element from both arrays sequentially. This tested my understanding of basic array handling in Java.

📥 Sample Input (predefined):
First Array: [2,4,6]
Second Array: [8,10,12,14]

📤 Output:
2 4 6 8 10 12 14

💡 Approach:

1. Calculate merged array size.
2.Copy first array into merged array.
3.Append second array to merged array.
4.Print the final merged array.

🛠️ Concepts Used:

1.Array initialization
2.Looping through arrays
3.Index manipulation

⏳ Time Complexity (TC): O(n+m) — where n = size of first array, m = size of second array
📦 Space Complexity (SC): O(n+m) — for the new merged array
