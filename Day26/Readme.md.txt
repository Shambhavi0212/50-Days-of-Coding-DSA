🧩 Problem Solved: Last Letter Vowel Challenge - Spec

📝 Today ,I :
Solved a string-based problem where I counted how many words in a sentence end with a vowel.
For example,in the sentence "Hello you are awesome", 4 words end with vowels.

💡 Approach:
1.Took input string.
2.Split into words using .split(" ").
3.Checked the last letter of each word.
4.Incremented counter if last letter is a vowel (considering both lowercase and uppercase).

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1.String Splitting
2.Loops
3.Character Checking

⏳ Time Complexity (TC): O(N) — because we process the entire input string once.
📦 Space Complexity (SC): O(N) — due to the array formed after splitting the string.
