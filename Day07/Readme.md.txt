✅ Problem Solved: "Difficulty Rating Order" (Java)

🔗 CodeChef Link: https://www.codechef.com/practice/course/arrays/ARRAYS/problems/RATINGINPRAC?tab=statement

Today, I solved a problem where the task was to determine whether the difficulty ratings of problems solved by students are in non-decreasing order. This means that the difficulties should either increase or remain the same across the problems, without decreasing at any point.

💡 Key Logic:

For each test case, check if the difficulty ratings are in non-decreasing order.

If any rating is greater than the next one, the sequence is not non-decreasing.

Output "Yes" if the sequence is valid, otherwise output "No".

📌 Language: Java
📚 Concepts Used: Arrays, Looping, Conditional Checks

📊 Sample Testcases were tested and validated successfully!

Time Complexity (TC):
O(N) - We loop through the array once for each test case.

Space Complexity (SC):
O(N) - We store the difficulty ratings in an array of size N.

🧠 This problem helped me strengthen my ability to loop through arrays and perform condition checks in a sequence, which is essential for solving many array-based problems in coding challenges.
