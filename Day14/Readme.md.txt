🚀 Day 1️⃣4️⃣/50 - Find the Unique Element in Sorted Array
 ✅ Problem Solved: 540. Single Element in a Sorted Array (Medium)

 🔗 LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/

🧩 Problem Statement
You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice,except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

🧪 Examples

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10

💡 Key Logic
- The array is sorted.
- All pairs appear consecutively except one element.
- Binary search can be used to eliminate half the array in each step.

🧠 Concepts Used
- Binary Search
- Pattern Recognition in Indexes
- Divide and Conquer

⏱ Time Complexity (TC)
O(log N) – Efficient binary search divides the array in half each time.

📦 Space Complexity (SC)
O(1) – No additional space used beyond a few variables.

📚 Language: Java

🧠 Learning Outcome:
- Strengthened binary search skills with edge case handling
- Understood index parity-based elimination
- Practiced optimizing both time and space in search problems
