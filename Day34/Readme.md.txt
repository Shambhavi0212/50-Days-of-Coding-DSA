🧩 Problem Solved: Word with Maximum Number of Vowels
📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Counting | Character Analysis
📝 Today, I:
Solved a problem to find and print the word with the highest number of vowels from a given lowercase string.
For example, for the input: "apple orange banana grape", the output was:
orange
The approach involved splitting the sentence into words, counting vowels in each word, and tracking the word with the max vowels.
💡 Approach:
1.Read the input string using Scanner.
2.Split the string into words.
3.For each word, count vowels by traversing each character.
4.Keep track of the word with the maximum vowel count.
5.Print the word with the most vowels

🛠️ Concepts Used:
String traversal and splitting
Character checks and conditional logic
Maintaining counters and comparison logic

⏳ Time Complexity(TC):O(N) — where N is total number of characters in the input string.
📦 Space Complexity(SC):O(N) — for storing the split words.
