🚀 Day 9️⃣/50 
✅ Problem Solved: "Reverse String"
📌 LeetCode: 344 (https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

🧩 Problem:
Given a char array s[], reverse it in-place using O(1) extra space.

🧪 Examples:
Input:  ["h","e","l","l","o"] → Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Input:  ["H","a","n","n","a","h"] → Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

🔍 Constraints:
1 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^5
s[i] is a printable ASCII character.

💡 Logic:
Use two-pointer approach. Swap characters from both ends moving toward the center.

⏱ TC:O(N) – Each character is visited once.
📦 SC:O(1) – Done in-place with constant space.
