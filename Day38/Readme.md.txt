🧩 Problem Solved: Most Frequent Character in a String

📊 Problem Type: String Traversal | Frequency Count | Tie-breaker Logic

📝 Today, I:
Solved a frequency-based string problem where I had to identify the character that appears most frequently in a lowercase string. In the event of a tie, the character that appears first is selected.
For example:

Input: apple → Output: p
Input: aabbcc → Output: a

💡 Approach:
1.Count frequency of each character using an integer array of size 26.
2.Traverse the string once more to detect the max frequency character while respecting the original order.
3.Print the result.

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1.Character Frequency Counting
2.Array-based Index Mapping (ch - 'a')
3.Greedy + Lexicographic Tie-breaking

⏳ Time Complexity:O(N)
📦 Space Complexity:O(1) (Fixed size array for 26 characters)
