🧩 Problem Solved: Check for Palindrome (ignoring case, spaces & punctuation)
📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Palindrome | Normalization

📝 Today, I:
Solved a text-cleaning and logic-based problem where I had to determine if a given string is a palindrome. The twist? It had to ignore casing, spaces, and punctuation.

📥 Example Input:
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama

📤 Output:
true

💡 Approach:
1. Read input string using Scanner.
2.Convert to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters using filtering.
3.Reverse the cleaned string and compare it with the original cleaned version.
4.If both match, it's a palindrome.

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1.StringBuilder for efficient string manipulation
2.Character filtering
3.Two-pointer/string reverse logic
4.String comparison

⏳ Time Complexity (TC): O(N) — One pass to clean, one to reverse
📦 Space Complexity (SC): O(N) — To store filtered string and reversed string
